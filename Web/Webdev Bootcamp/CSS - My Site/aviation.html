      Switched from doing Communication & Information Systems (CIS) in the RNLAF
      to becoming an aircraft engineer in 2014. Always had a great interest in
      aviation and was lucky enough to be able to do an apprenticeship that
      started my career in this industry. Over the years I gained a lot of
      experience and settled into the role of an avionics engineer!
