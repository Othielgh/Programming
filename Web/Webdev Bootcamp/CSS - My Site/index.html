          <h3>B2 LAE</h3>
          <p>
            Switched from doing Communication & Information Systems (CIS) in the
            RNLAF to becoming an aircraft engineer in 2014. Always had a great
            interest in aviation and was lucky enough to be able to do an
            apprenticeship that started my career in this industry. Over the
            years I gained a lot of experience and settled into the role of an
            avionics engineer!

          <h3>Development & Cyber security</h3>
          <p>
            Even though I switched careers I also maintain my interest in
            computer technologies. Mainly Cyber security and Programming. Cyber
            Security is more as a hobby by doing online CTFs and trying to stay
            aware of what is going on in the industry. Recently started to learn
            Web Development and hope to learn enough to maybe help generate some
            passive income.
